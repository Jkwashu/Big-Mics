# Big-Mics
The audience for the app is anyone who can produce sufficient sound to register on the microphone. It is meant to be a game accesible to most people.

The app includes a screen with a player-controlled sprite that “jumps” when the microphone registers. There is also a second screen with a slider for the microphone that indicates the strength of the input and displays the minimum threshold for making the sprite “jump.”

This app is useful as a source of entertainment. It is a fun game, as well as a fun way to test out your microphone sensor.
